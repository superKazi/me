# Hi, I’m Kazi.

Netlify “builds” this code to make my website.

### I used:
- [Subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont) to do fancy font loading/subsetting stuff
	- PolySans is by [Gradient](https://wearegradient.net/about/)
- This [wonderful tool](https://utopia.fyi) to create the fluid type scale
- Andrey Sitnik’s [favicon strategy](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)
- Some stuff from this [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset)
- [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) to track you if/when you visit
- [Instant dot page](https://instant.page) to make any links you might click a bit speedier to load
- Several css animations from various libraries I can’t remember 😬 but are easy enough to find in your preferred search engine
